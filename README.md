# CloudUX Simple App
This is an example application that covers some of the Cloud UX APIs.
Be aware that many of these APIs are not considered stable and will
change without notice.

## General project setup
This sample does not use the webpack setup provided by Avid, instead
it uses a minimal `webpack.config.js` that covers the basics.
